## Today's Objective: Markdown Editor

NOTES:

1.30pm - Coding ends

2.30pm - Code Review + Votes end

## Objective

Today's objective is to create your own Markdown Editor that actually saves to Express!

Markdown, as you probably already know, is a formatting language for text-based documents. This document is written in Markdown. You can see its source to get a taste for what Markdown looks like.

Some examples of Markdown Editors include:

* [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/) (simple web-based)
* [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io/) (simple web-based)
* [Typora](https://typora.io/) (installed, with advanced features)
* [hackmd](https://hackmd.io/) (this is a lot more than just a simple markdown editor)

## Requirements

### 1. Create a Markdown editor, like the above, that has the following components:

* Input area
* Compilation logic (you can use a library for this)
* Preview panel (no need to do live preview, using a submit button is fine)

Also, you should try to have a good stylesheet for the output HTML (you can use something like Bootstrap, Bulma, etc.)

### 2. Save your form to Express

You should save your form to Express such that anyone can access the data online after you've submitted it!

### Bonus points

You get bonus points for any features other than the above that you can successfully demo. 

For example:

* Live preview (where your edits in the input area automatically show up in the preview panel)
* Syntax highlighting for input area
* Selectable themes for input area
* Selectable themes for preview panel
* Print to PDF
* Locally installed (using Electron, for example)
* Responsive design 

That's it!

The most interesting, useful, and cool designs will have a chance of winning -- and they must be written well, too. So, get creative :-)

## How to build a simple markdown editor

Building a markdown editor is remarkably simple. You can use libraries for a lot of the functionality, and stitch them together using JavaScript logic.

Here are some suggested components for the various components above:

### Input Area - Suggested Libraries

* Ace Editor

### Compilation Logic

* [Showdown](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown)
* [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it)
* [markedjs](https://github.com/markedjs/marked)

### Preview Panel

Well, for this one, you just output the compiled HTML to the DOM. :-)

## Frameworks:

It is completely possible to build this using jQuery. 

You can use React, Vue, Angular if you wish.

## Restrictions

* Your project must use JavaScript.

There are no other restrictions.
